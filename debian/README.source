Subject: Re: Debian enquiry about data files in munsell

I obtained real.dat from http://www.cis.rit.edu/mcsl/online/munsell.php 
which is a digitization of Table 1 in:   S. M. NEWHALL, D. NICKERSON, and 
D. B. JUDD. Final report of the o.s.a. subcommittee on the spacing of the 
munsell colors. J. Opt. Soc. Am., 33(7):385â€“411, 07 1943.

It shouldn't be copyrighted for two reasons: (1) it's data, (2) it's 
produced by employees of the federal govt,  but I don't have any proof of 
that.

I'm updating my package documentation to improve the description of the 
source data.

Charlotte
